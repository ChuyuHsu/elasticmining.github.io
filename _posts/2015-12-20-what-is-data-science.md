After all these buzzes about data science. Public starts referring to **data science** or another over hyped term **Big Data** as some sort of magic making a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.

Nah, it is only part of the whole story. I bet you must have a question coming to your mind. And to this very one question, no one can accurately answer.


> What is Data Science? 


To me, data science is more like art instead of science. It is more like a process to extract the value from a dark tunnel 1000-ft down the data mountain. We still do things in a scientific way. But how to do it? It is more like an artisan stuff, of which success needs tremendous commitment.


This most frequently asked question haunts people around these years. The debate for the answer of this question seems not be settled yet. Sometimes, we cannot tell something apart from its look, but it won't stop us trying to investigate from its activities. Since giving a formal definition of data science is difficult, why not take a look what data science is all about?


According to wikipedia, it could be a really mess.

As you can see, some of the domains you may already be familiar with, but for some you totally have no clue. This full-stack of skills makes describe data science like trying to describe a sunset - you know the feeling, however, capturing the appropriate words is impossible. For a better understanding, if you lookup the data science track on O'Reilly[^3], you will find out that data science is mixed up with multiple different topics and disciplines which cover from **statistics**, **business strategy** to **computer science**.

Basically, the work in the data science can covered by three fields as follows:

## 1. Statistics and Mathematics

Most of  important theories are done by mathematicians and statisticians. The statisticians are always best problem solvers for your data science team. They have a bunch of specialities to model any data problem like statistical modeling, signal processing, probability models, pattern recognition, or predictive analytics.

Yes, data science becomes real magic when there are magicain-like methemacians plays a part in a team, who discover unexpected actionable insights. Although great mathematicians are a key role to any data science department, they cannot and do not work alone.


## 2. Computer Science

Although mathematics and statistics are playing important roles in a data science team, without computer science, it is hard to scale up, and not to service in real-time like Google did. 

In some respects, data science only exists in computer science. We can say that, the remarkable advance in computer science and computing hardware ignites this data science hype.

Hardwares are being designed, new algorithms are invented, new tools and new set of skills are being proposed to handle this emerging new field. A CTO/CIO in a coorperate needs totally different mindset and skills to handle new data problems. In fact, almost everything you need for your data science team will need to be purposely built, rented, borrowed or partnered with.


## 3. Domain Knowledge

After all, skills and methematics would not produce value themselves. You know your business, and that is the most important than anything. Without a appropriate purpose, any data science team is merely a waste.

In order to extract value out of data and make it work. You need to put the best of your business knowledge, invaluable experiences and intuitions to ask the right questions, the correct purposes to your data science team.


# Summary

What is data science? It is actually mixed up with multiple fields like statistics, methmatics, computer science and business. That’s why everyone has his own definition for data science. It is pretty much an art of extracting insights from data. Working on data science needs so much different skills and knowledges, playing solo becomes nearly impossible for most of scenerio. ([Why you need a data science team instead of a data scientist?](/post/2015-12-15/why-do-you-need-a-data-science-team.html)) 

As a result, starting a data science team is difficult, because the skill set shifts dramatically from past Web 2.0 age. We, ElasticMining, can help you jump-start your data science project without all the burdens of building a qualified data science team. We are a more than qualified data science team.
